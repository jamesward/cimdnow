## Agent tooling

- Follow the `zen-of-projects` Skill (extract with `./sbta extractSkillsJars` into the gitignored `.kiro/skills/`); this file records only project-specific facts and exceptions. Read the relevant Skills before working.
- For Scala 3 and ZIO code (writing or reviewing it), follow `zen-of-scala`.
- For design, domain modeling, effects and testing strategy, follow `zen-of-james`.
- MCP server `sbta` (this build's `./sbta --mcp`, configured in `.mcp.json` and `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, approved in `.claude/settings.json`): use it for all sbt work: `compile`, `test` (`full` for all), `run`, `check` after editing Scala 3 sources, `glob-search` / `inspect` / `symbol-location` for symbols, `sbt-task` for any other command. Its tools are deferred in Claude Code: load them with ToolSearch (search `sbta`). If it's unavailable, say so and use `./sbta <command>`. Logs: `project/target/sbta/mcp.log`.
- Maintenance routine: `.factory/MAINTENANCE.md` (weekly), following the `zen-of-projects` Skill.

## Exceptions to the Skill

- Scala stays on 3.9.0: Scala Native 0.5.12 has no final `scala3lib_native0.5_3` for 3.10.0 (only 3.10.0-RC1..RC3). Bump Scala once Scala Native publishes it (CI's `nativeLink` fails with "Not found" otherwise).
